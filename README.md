ITU Solar Car Team – Weekly Assignment

This repository contains the weekly software assignments conducted within the Istanbul Technical University Solar Car Team. The aim of these studies is to learn fundamental software concepts through the C++ programming language, improve algorithmic thinking skills, and build a basic software infrastructure that can be used in team projects.

The repository includes examples related to C++ fundamentals, basic applications, and small-scale simulations. These studies cover topics such as variables, conditional statements, loops, functions, and struct usage. In addition, a simple calculator application, point structure examples, and a basic simulation based on robot dead reckoning are also included.

This project was developed for learning and practice purposes, to support individual development and to provide a foundation for software-related work within the Solar Car Team.
